About:
E-Commerce is a React application for online shopping. This application can be viewed on any device, providing a dynamic experience no matter where you are. Both the front end and back end were built from the ground up, allowing for scalable and customizable features to meet user needs. This is the first full-stack application I have built, and I would love to hear your feedback on how I can improve. Please send me an email or message me on GitHub. To learn more about this program, see my documents for a deeper explanation. Documents link (<https://github.com/DDurant94/E-Commerce-React/blob/main/documents/documents.txt>)
